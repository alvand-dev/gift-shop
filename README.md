# Gift Shop Theme

It is a modern modular gift shop e-commerce responsive website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This theme, tested in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (September 2021).

I didnâ€™t use any CSS or JS framework. Gift Shop Theme built with relatively new CSS techniques like flexbox and grid system as needed.

I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes and also use Fontawesome Solid and Lato regular font.

All of the images are free to use, and most of them are from unsplash.com.
