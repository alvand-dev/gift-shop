# Gift Shop Theme

It is a modern modular giftshop e-commerce responsive website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I tested it in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (September 2021).

I didn't use any CSS or JS framework. But Responsive layout media query sizes are based on the Bootstrap 4 grid system. I used relatively new CSS techniques like flexbox and grid system as needed.

I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes and Splide.js for building sliders. I also use Fontawesome Solid and Lato regular font. All of the images are free to use, and most of them are from unsplash.com.
